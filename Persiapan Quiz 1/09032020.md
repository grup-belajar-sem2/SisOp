# Soal 1
Consider the following code:
```c
for (i = 0; i < 20; i++)
    for (j = 0; j < 10; j++)
        a[i] = a[i] * j
```

# Soal 2
An I/O-bound program is one that, if run alone, would spend more time waiting for I/O than using the processor. A processor-bound program is the opposite. Suppose a short-term scheduling algorithm favors those programs that have used little processor time in the recent past. Explain why this algorithm favors I/O-bound programs and yet does not permanently deny processor time to processor-bound programs.

# Soal 3
It was stated that UNIX is unsuitable for real-time applications because a process executing in kernel mode may not be preempted. Elaborate
```md

# Soal 4
Consider an enviroment in which there is a one-to-one mapping between user-level threads and kernel-level threads that allows one or more threads withing a process to issue blocking system calls while other threads continue to run. Explain why this model can make multithreaded programs run faster than their single-threaded counterparts on a uniprocessor computer.
